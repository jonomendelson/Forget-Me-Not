# Forget-Me-Not

Won 1st prize at HackTrin III.

A program that stimulates and tracks the progress of patients with Alzheimers by routinely administering tests and memory games chosen to specifically test common markers of Alzheimers. Often, it is difficult for caretakers to tell if their patient's condition is deteriorating - our application allows caretakers to easily test multiple patients at a time and clearly view their progress.

The patient is administered multiple choice questions that include math problems, common sense problems, and questions pertaining to historical events. The patient is also administed a time telling game, as time telling often becomes difficult for those who have Alzheimers. 

The program allows the caretaker to register the patient and save the patients progress as a file, allowing the caretaker to administer later tests to the patient without losing previous progress. If the patient's progress slips suddenly, the caretaker is notified via email.

We created Forget-Me-Not in C++, C#, and SFML.

Created by Jonathan Mendelson, Michael Caosun, Jake Sanders, and Teddy Rashkover.
